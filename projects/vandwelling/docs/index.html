                    <h1>Formalities for vandwelling and international travel.</h1>
                    <p>
                        These are the ways we handle some legal and bureaucratic aspects that I think are worth sharing. 
                        They work for us but may not be the best for you, so always do your research.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Entry</h2> 
                    <p>
                        Passports are a global requirement for international travel, but they are treated differently depending on the issuing country.
                        <a href="https://www.henleyglobal.com/passport-index/ranking" target="_blank"> Some people are free to travel across continents, while others will likely be completely barred from entry in most countries</a>.
                        It is not fair. Ideally, everyone would be granted the same rights. 
                        But this is the reality of how borders currently work, and the best thing to do is understand the system, stay informed, and plan accordingly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dual citizenship (Brazilian and Italian) allows us to enter
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercosur" target="_blank">Mercosur</a> countries without a visa and to stay indefinitely in the
                        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union" target="_blank">EU</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Area" target="_blank">Schengen Area</a>. 
                        Outside these regions, restrictions vary, so we still need to consider visa applications and permitted length of stay.

                    <h2>Vaccination</h2>
                    <p>
                        Some countries require proof of vaccination against diseases such as yellow fever.
                        It is important to check the <a href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/countries" target="_blank">specific requirements</a> for each one.
                        The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Certificate_of_Vaccination_or_Prophylaxis" target="_blank">ICVP</a> is recognised globally.

                    <h2>Vehicle</h2>
                    <p>
                        Many countries require residency to register a vehicle, and standard insurance policies often exclude full-time living.
                        To address this, we use a <a href="https://mycarturf.com/" target="_blank">service</a> that provides a legal address for vehicle registration and insurance purposes.
                        There are <a href="https://mygermancar.com/" target="_blank">other, similar alternatives</a> available.
                        They are completely legal and help travellers and nomads stay compliant and protected.
