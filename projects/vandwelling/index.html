                    <p>
                        Since 2025, Guilherme and I have been living in a 6-metre-long campervan. 
                        We experiment with different ways of managing resources and waste outside the electricity, water, and sewage grids. 
                        I will share some of what we have learned on these pages.

                    <h2>On nomadism</h2>
                    <p>
                        Somewhere in our mid-20s, we gradually began living more simply and deliberately. 
                        By <i>simply</i>, I mean frugally, minimally, and closer to the wild.
                        <i>Deliberately</i>, in this case, means making decisions based on our own values, rather than convenience or external expectations. 
                        Already at that time, our sense of home and community was quite vague.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2022, we moved from Brazil to Malta, where we spent some time working remotely and began traveling more often. 
                        This was a great opportunity to learn languages, experience cultures, and develop empathy and curiosity. 
                        But we then realised that simplicity requires a certain amount of continuity, as constant change inevitably generates some form of waste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, seeking a balance between mobility and stability, we decided to buy a second-hand campervan that became our home for now, and also a kind of testbed. 
                        It gave us the flexibility to experiment with small-scale systems as we slowly move through Europe and, eventually, into Africa and Asia.
