                    <p>
                        Since 2025, Guilherme and I have been living in a 6-metre-long campervan. 
                        We experiment with different ways of managing resources and waste outside the electricity, water, and sewage grids. 
                        I will share some of what we have learned on these pages.

                    <h2>On home and nomadism</h2>
                    <p>
                        Somewhere in our mid-20s, we gradually began to live more simply and deliberately. 
                        By <i>simple</i>, I mean frugal, minimal, raw.
                        <i>Deliberate</i>, in this context, means making decisions based on values, instead of convenience or external expectations. 
                        Already at that time, our sense of home and community was becoming quite vague.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2022, we moved from Brazil to Malta, where we spent some time working remotely and began travelling more often. 
                        That was a great opportunity to learn languages and experience cultures, as well as to realise that simplicity also requires continuity, 
                        as constant change inevitably generates some form of waste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Looking mostly for a balance between mobility and stability, we purchased a second-hand campervan that became our home, and also a kind of testbed. 
                        It provide us the flexibility to experiment with small-scale systems as we slowly move through Europe, Africa, and Asia.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I certainly didn't choose to live on the road just for the sake of travelling. 
                        It took some goals and passion to trade what once seemed important for uncertainty. 
                        And ever since, I've felt a humbling sense of presence. 
                        We have seen every sunset, camped near mountains, swum in hidden lakes, and met amazing people. 
                        When the time comes to leave, there will be no regrets, for we have already seen more of this world than we ever imagined.
