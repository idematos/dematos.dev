                    <h1>Off the grid.</h1>
                    <p>
                        Since 2025, I have been living in an 8 mÂ² campervan with my husband, Guilherme. 
                        Together we experiment with different ways of managing resources outside the electricity, water, and sewage grids. 
                        I will share some of what we have learned on the following pages.

                    <h2>Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        Somewhere in our mid-20s, we gradually began to live in a way that felt simpler and more intentional to us.
                        By <i>simple</i>, I mean frugal, minimal, and close to the wild. 
                        <i>Intentionality</i>, in this case, means the ability to base our choices on our own values rather than convenience or other people's expectations. 
                        This led us to move from Brazil to Malta in 2022, where we spent some time working remotely and began traveling more frequently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Travel was an opportunity to learn languages and experience different cultures, as well as to develop empathy and curiosity. 
                        But, at some point, we realised that simplicity requires a certain amount of continuity, as constant change inevitably generates some form of waste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seeking to balance mobility with stability, we opted to purchase a second-hand campervan that became our home and a kind of testbed. 
                        It gave us the flexibility to experiment with small-scale systems as we slowly move across Europe and, eventually, into Africa and Asia.
