                    <p>
                        Since 2025, Guilherme and I have been living in a 6-metre-long campervan. 
                        We experiment with different ways of managing resources and waste outside the electricity, water and sewage grids. 
                        I will share some of what we have learned on these pages.

                    <h2>Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        In our mid-20s, we gradually began to live more simply and deliberately.
                        By <i>simply</i>, I mean frugally, minimally, and closer to the wild. 
                        <i>Deliberately</i>, in this case, means making decisions based on our own values rather than convenience or external expectations. 
                        Even then, our sense of home and community was rather vague. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2022, we moved from Brazil to Malta, where we spent some time working remotely and began travelling more often.
                        It was a great opportunity to learn languages, experience different cultures, and to develop empathy and curiosity. 
                        But we realised that simplicity requires a certain continuity, as constant change inevitably generates some form of waste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, seeking to balance mobility with stability, we decided to purchase a second-hand campervan that became our home for now. 
                        It gave us the flexibility to experiment with small-scale systems as we slowly move across Europe and, eventually, into Africa and Asia.
