                <h1>Websites can drain energy at multiple levels.</h1>
                <p>
                    This includes end-user devices, network infrastructure, and servers. 
                </p>

                <h3>Devices</h3>
                <p>
                    The power consumption of devices depends on the CPU (main processor), GPU (graphics processing unit), network, and display. 
                    The display's power consumption is relatively constant and under the user's control (through adjustments to screen time and brightness). 
                    However, the CPU, GPU, and network hardware can have a significant variability in power consumption. 
                    The system adjusts the performance of the CPU and GPU based on the tasks being processed at a given time, including rendering webpages. 
                    This is made by turning certain components on or off and modifying their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate" target="_blank">clock rate</a>. 
                    So, the greater the performance demanded of the chips, the less energy efficient they become. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reducing the amount of time spent in high-power states, and letting the hardware go back to idle as much as possible can significantly reduce energy consumption.
                    This can be done by reducing the use of timers, <a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8582/intersectionobserver-in-webkit/" target="_blank">running animations only when visible</a>, 
                    prioritising CSS <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation" target="_blank">animations</a> and 
                    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transitions/Using_CSS_transitions" target="_blank">transitions</a> over script-driven ones, 
                    and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" target="_blank">WebSockets</a> over network polling.
                </p>

                <h3>Network</h3>
                <p>
                    Transmitting data over the Internet involves routers and switches, content delivery networks (CDNs), and mobile networks.
                    Routers and switches consume energy to process and forward data packets, CDNs are used to cache and deliver data closer to users,
                    and mobile networks consume energy to transmit data to and from wireless devices.              
                    Optimising the data exchanged between users and servers can reduce energy use across the network. 
                    This can be done with caching, reducing unnecessary API calls and minimizing payload sizes.
                </p>

                <h3>Servers</h3>
                <p>
                    Data centers house servers that store, process, and serve web content. The major contributors to energy use are
                    server operations (run application logic, manage databases, and render content), cooling systems
                    (maintain optimal temperatures for server performance), and idle power usage.
                    Reducing the complexity and size of webpages can significantly reduce energy consumption on both user devices and servers.
                    This can be done by compressing media, using lazy loading, and reducing computational overhead in JavaScript.
