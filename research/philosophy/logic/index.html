                <h1>Logic studies the process of argumentation.</h1>
                <p>                    
                    A <b>proposition</b> is any statement that can be judged as either true or false. 
                    Thus, there is always a binary value attributed to it: its <b>truth value</b>, 
                    which can be either true (<i>T</i>) or false (<i>F</i>), with no third option. 
                    This property is called the Principle of the Excluded Middle. 
                    Together with the Principle of Identity (which states that every being is identical to itself) 
                    and the Principle of Non-Contradiction (which states that no proposition can be both true and false simultaneously), 
                    they form the foundation of Aristotle's classical logic.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A logical <b>argument</b> is a sequence of propositions, such that the initial ones are the premises and the 
                    last one is the conclusion.
                </p>
                <p><b>First premise</b>: <i>All humans are mortal.</i></p>
                <p><b>Second premise</b>: <i>I am human.</i></p>
                <p><b>Conclusion</b>: <i>Therefore, I am mortal.</i></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <p>
                    An argument also consists of <b>connectives</b>, which are the structures responsible for combining one 
                    or more propositions to produce a new, more complex one.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Negation (¬)</h3>
                <p>
                    It has the function of changing the meaning of a proposition to the opposite meaning. 
                    For example, given the proposition <i>p</i>: “<i>I like camping</i>”, the proposition ¬<i>p</i> will be “<i>I do not like camping</i>”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The propositions <i>p</i> and ¬<i>p</i> always have different logical values. That is, when <i>p</i> is true, ¬<i>p</i> is false and vice versa. 
                </p>

                <table>
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th><i>p</i></th>

                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td><i>T</i></td>

                <h3>Conjunction (∧) and disjunction (∨)</h3>
                <p>
                    It is used to combining two propositions <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>. 
                    While the conjunction represents the sense of complementarity, the disjunction represents the sense of simultaneity. 
                    For example, for the sentence “<i>The sky is blue <b>or</b> the sea is red</i>” to be true, it is enough that one of the sentences: 
                    “<i>The sky is blue</i>” or “<i>The sea is red</i>” is true. On the other hand, for the sentence “<i>The sky is blue <b>and</b> the sea is red</i>” 
                    to be true, it is necessary that both sentences are true. 
                </p>

                <h3>Conditional (→)</h3>
                <p>
                    It is used to formulate a proposition that conveys an idea of cause and effect. 
                    An example of a sentence that has this meaning is <i>“If it breaks, then she fix it</i>”. 
                    Symbolically, this sentence is represented as <i>p → q</i>, where  <i>p</i>: “<i>It breaks</i>” and <i>q</i>: “<i>She fix it</i>”. 
                </p>

                    This is an adaptation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task" target="_blank">an experiment proposed by Wason</a> 
                    that sought to understand whether people knew how to intuitively use classical logic.

                    The five cards <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, <b>M</b> are on a table, and each has a number on one side and a letter on the other. 
                    We must decide whether the following proposition is true:  
                </p>
                <p>
                    "<i>If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even number on the other side.</i>"

                    First, we have to turn over cards <b>A</b> and <b>E</b>, which are vowels.
                    In fact, if on the other side of them there is an odd number, the proposition will be false.
                    Note that we do not need to turn over card <b>M</b> (which is a consonant), because, regardless of the number on the other side,
                    the proposition will never be invalidated. We have to turn over card <b>3</b>, because if we have a vowel on the other side,
                    the proposition will be false. Finally, it is not necessary to turn over card <b>2</b>, since
                    regardless of the letter on the other side, the sentence cannot be invalidated. Therefore, we have to turn over three cards: <b>3</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>.

                <h2>Gods</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Hardest_Logic_Puzzle_Ever&oldid=906163668" target="_blank">more challenging puzzle</a>,
                    published in The Harvard Review of Philosophy in 1996.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Three gods A, B, and C are called, in no particular order, True, False, and Random. 
                    True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. 
                    Your task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question must be put to exactly one god. 
                    The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language, in which the words for yes and no are <i>da</i> and <i>ja</i>, in some order. 
                    You do not know which word means which.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This puzzle is very tricky, mainly because of the Random god, who gives meaningless answers, and the language barrier.
                    So let's first consider two simpler versions before moving on to the general case.
                </p>

                <h4>The Puzzle Without the Language Barrier</h4>
                
                <p> Imagine for now that we understand the gods' language and can translate their answers into simple <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>. So, we have:</p>

                <ul style="list-style: decimal;">
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            If you know that a god is either True or False (not Random), you can figure out which one is which by simply asking them something you already know the answer to.
                            For example, by asking "Is 1 + 1 = 2?", True will say <i>yes</i>, and False will say <i>no</i>.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you know that a god is True, you can figure out who the other two are by pointing to one of the other gods and asking "Is this Random?".</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the answer is <i>yes</i>, that god is Random, and the remaining one must be False.</li>
                            <li>If the answer is <i>no</i>, that god is False, and the remaining one is Random.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you know that a god is False, you can figure out the other two in the same way as you would in (2).</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    From this, we see that the key is to ask one question to identify a god who isn't Random. 
                    Once you find that god, you can figure out if they're True or False by asking them, "Is 1 + 1 = 2?" 
                    Then you can use the process above to identify the others.
                </p>

                <h4>Finding a Non-Random God</h4>

                <p>To identify a god who isn't Random, you can ask any of the gods: "Are you True if and only if this other god is Random?" pointing to one of the other two.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you're asking True, they'll say <i>yes</i> if you're pointing at Random, and <i>no</i> if you're pointing at False.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you're asking False, they'll lie: they'll say <i>yes</i> if you're pointing at Random, and <i>no</i> if you're pointing at True.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you're asking Random, their answer is useless, but the god you're pointing at and the remaining god are definitely not Random.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    So, if the answer is <i>yes</i>, the third god (neither the one you're pointing at nor the one you're questioning) is not Random. 
                    If the answer is <i>no</i> the god you're pointing at is not Random.
                </p>

                <h4>The General Case</h4>

                <p>
                    Now let's return to the original puzzle, where the gods answer <i>da</i> and <i>ja</i>. The same strategy works, but with a twist.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Before asking a question, you can start by saying, "The word <i>da</i> means <i>yes</i> if and only if…" and then follow it with the question as before. This way:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>If the god would have answered <i>yes</i> in English, they'll say <i>da</i>.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>If the god would have answered <i>no</i> in English, they'll say <i>ja</i>.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This adjustment lets you translate the gods' answers back into <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i> and solve the puzzle the same way as before.
                </p>
