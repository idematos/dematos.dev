                <h1>Envy is a complex emotion and an often avoided topic.</h1>
                <p>
                    To avoid bringing it, envy it is sometimes referred to as jealousy, but these are distinct emotions. Jealousy 
                    is the fear of losing something one possesses to another, while envy is a painful 
                    awareness of another's advantage, accompanied by a desire to possess that 
                    advantage or to see it diminished.

                <h3>The Comparative Dimension</h3>
                <p>
                    Envy is relational and comparative, meaning that it only arises in contexts where one 
                    measures their worth against another and, from the perspective of the envier, it is 
                    sufficient that the envied is in a slightly advantageous position relative to them.

                <h3>The Moral Evaluation</h3>
                <p>
                    Traditionally, envy has been classified as a vice, condemned for its corrosive effects on individual character and social harmony. 
                    Immanuel Kant counts envy among the "vices of misanthropy that are just opposite to human love",
                    and Christian moral philosophy lists it among the seven deadly sins.
