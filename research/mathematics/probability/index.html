                <h1>Probability is a numerical representation of how likely an event is to occur.</h1>
                <p>
                    A random experiment is any experiment whose outcome cannot be predicted. 
                    The set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment is called the <b>sample space</b>, and an <b>event</b> is any subset of the sample space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simply put, given a random experiment and two events from it, say A and B, we say that the probability of event A occurring, 
                    given that we are already certain event B occurs, is a <b>conditional probability</b>.

                <h2>Intuition and Probability</h2>

                <p>
                    In some cases, especially those involving conditional probability, calculations may contradict our intuition. Here is an example of such a situation:
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a country, 10% of the population is carrying a virus. A test to detect the presence of the virus has 90% accuracy when applied to carriers and 80% accuracy when applied to non-carriers. 
                    What percentage of people actually carry the virus among those whom the test classified as carriers?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let us see a solution that does not cite probability theorems.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Assume that the test was applied to the <i>N</i> inhabitants of the country. The number of tests that indicated the presence of the virus was:
                </p>

                <div class="center">
                    $$
                    0,9\times 0,1 \times N + 0,2 \times 0,9 \times N = 0,27 N
                    $$
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    where the first portion represents the 90% who are actually carriers and the second portion represents the 20% who are not carriers. 
                    Therefore, of the total, 0.27 <i>N</i>, 0.09 <i>N</i> are carriers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, 0.09 <i>N</i> / 0.27 <i>N</i> = 1/3 â‰ˆ 33.3% of the people whom the test classified as carriers are actually carriers of the virus.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This number shows that a person who has taken the test and been classified as a carrier has a high chance of being a false positive.
                    Typically, when a person takes a test of this type and the result is positive, doctors recommend a new test.
