                <h1>Primes are fundamental, indivisible parts of natural numbers.</h1>
                <p>
                    A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be divided by any other natural, apart from 1 and itself.
                    Every natural number greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers. 
                    This result is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

                <h2>There are infinitely many prime numbers.</h2>
                <p>Here's an argument by contradiction that proves the infinitude of primes:</p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        Suppose there are finitely many primes. Let p be the product of all primes. Thus, p is divisible by all primes.
                        The number p+1 is not divisible by any divisor of p. Therefore, p+1 is prime and does not divide p, which leads to a contradiction.

                <h2>Distribution of Primes</h2>
                <p>
                    The distribution of primes among the integers looks irregular, but it follows a predictable asymptotic pattern.
                </p>
                <h3>The Prime Number Theorem</h3>
                <p>
                    It states that the number of primes less than a given number <i>N</i> is approximately equal to the natural logarithm of <i>N</i>. 
                    In other words, the average gap between consecutive prime numbers among the first <i>N</i> integers is roughly <i>ln(N)</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This theorem formalises the intuitive notion that primes become less common as they grow larger, by precisely quantifying the rate at which this occurs.
                </p>
                <h3>Riemann Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    This is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. It posits that the Riemann zeta function 
                    has its non-trivial zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part 1/2. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The validity of the Riemann Hypothesis has strong implications for the distribution of primes. 
                    Specifically, it predicts tighter bounds on the error term in the Prime Number Theorem.
