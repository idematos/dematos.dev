                <h1>Primes are fundamental parts of natural numbers.</h1>
                <p>
                    A prime is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be divided by any other number apart from 1 and itself. 
                    Every natural number greater than 1 can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers. 
                    This result is known as the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic.

                <h2>There are infinitely many prime numbers.</h2>
                <p>The following argument by contradiction shows the infinitude of primes:</p>
                <p>
                    <i>
                        Suppose there are finitely many primes. Let p be the product of all primes. 
                        Thus, p is divisible by all primes. The number p + 1 is not divisible by any divisor of p. 
                        Therefore, p + 1 is prime and does not divide p, which is a contradiction.
                        Hence, the hypothesis that there are a finite number of primes was wrong. 
                        So, it can be stated that there are infinitely many primes.

                <h2>Distribution of Primes</h2>
                <p>
                    The distribution of primes among the integers follows an asymptotic pattern.
                </p>
                <h3>The Prime Number Theorem</h3>
                <p>
                    It states that the number of primes less than a given number <i>N</i> is approximately equal to the natural logarithm of <i>N</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, basically, this theorem says that primes become rarer as they grow larger.
                </p>
                <h3>Riemann Hypothesis</h3>
                <p>
                    It posits that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function" target="_blank">Riemann zeta function</a> 
                    has its non-trivial zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with a real part of 1/2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This hypothesis predicts tighter bounds on the error term in the Prime Number Theorem, 
                    so its validity would lead to a closed formula for finding prime numbers. 
                    However, it has not yet been proven to date.
