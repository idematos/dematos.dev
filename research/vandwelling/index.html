                    For many years, Guilherme and I have sought to live a simple and more intentional life.
                    By <i>simple</i>, I mean frugal, minimalist, and close to the wild.
                    <i>Intentional</i>, in this context, would mean making choices aligned with our own values rather than convenience or other peopleâ€™s expectations.
                    This initially led us to move from Brazil to Malta in 2022, where we spent some time working remotely and reflecting on our sense of home and community.

                    We saw travel as a natural way to learn new languages and experience different cultures, as well as to develop empathy, curiosity, and creativity.
                    But we came to realise that simplicity also requires stability, as constant change inevitably generates some form of waste.

                    A tiny, mobile dwelling seemed like the right balance between movement and continuity.
                    So we bought a second-hand campervan that became our home and a kind of laboratory.
                    It gave us space and flexibility to experiment with low-tech and self-sufficient systems as we travel slowly through Europe and, eventually, towards Africa and Asia.
