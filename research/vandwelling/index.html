                    Over the years, Guilherme and I have leaned towards simplicity and intentionality. 
                    By <i>simplicity</i>, I mean frugality, minimalism, rawness.
                    <i>Intentionality</i>, in this context, means basing our choices on our own values, rather than convenience or external expectations.
                    This first led us to move from Brazil to Malta in 2022, where we spent some time working remotely and reflecting on our sense of home and community.

                    We also saw travel as a way to learn new languages and experience different cultures, as well as to develop empathy, curiosity, and creativity.
                    But we came to realise that simplicity also requires stability, as constant change inevitably generates some form of waste.

                    A small, mobile dwelling seemed like the right balance between movement and continuity.
                    So we bought a second-hand campervan that became our home and a kind of laboratory.
                    It gave us space and flexibility to experiment with small-scale systems as we travel slowly through Europe and, eventually, towards Africa and Asia.
