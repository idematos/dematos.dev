                    For many years, Guilherme and I have sought to live in a simple and more intentional way.
                    By <i>simple</i>, I mean frugal, minimalist, and close to the wild.
                    By <i>intentional</i>, I mean making choices guided by our own values rather than by convenience or other people's expectations.
                    This first led us to move from Brazil to Malta in 2022, where we spent some time working remotely and reflecting on our sense of home and community.

                    Travel became a natural way to learn new languages and experience different cultures, as well as to develop empathy, curiosity, and creativity.
                    Yet we came to realise that simplicity also requires stability, as constant change inevitably generates some form of waste.

                    The idea of a tiny, mobile dwelling seemed a suitable way to combine movement with continuity.
                    So we bought a second-hand campervan that became both our home and our laboratory.
                    It gives us the freedom to experiment with low-tech and self-sufficient systems as we travel slowly through Europe and, eventually, Africa and Asia.

                    In these pages, I will share some of the practices, adaptations, and outcomes from this ongoing experiment.

                    People talk of freedom as if it were loud.<br/>
                    But it is quiet, and often boring.<br/>
                    Which is a relief.
