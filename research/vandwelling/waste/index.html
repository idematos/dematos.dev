                <q>We are the only animal that deliberately mixes water with our own waste. That's important because you create such a treatment issue to clean that water up. It's ecological insanity.</q>

                    Our van came with a cassette toilet, which is a tank similar to a conventional household toilet, but with chemical additives (formaldehyde or quaternary ammonium compounds) 
                    to control odour and break down solids. These additives are used to suppress bacteria, but they also prevent natural decomposition and require disposal at special designated points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A more sustainable option would be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composting_toilet" target="_blank">composting toilet</a>, 
                    but since the van already had a fully functioning unit, I decided to repurpose it into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine-diverting_dry_toilet" target="_blank">similar dry system</a> to prevent waste.

                <h2>Repurposing a cassette toilet as a urine-diverting dry toilet</h2>
                <p>
                    When liquids and solids are kept separate, they are both manageable and even useful.
                </p>
                <h3>Liquids</h3>
                <p>
                    The original tank is now used only for urine. It is odourless if diluted and emptied regularly. 
                    Urine is composed primarily of water, with nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (which are nutrients for plants). 
                    When safe and legal to do so, it can be diluted with water (about 1:10) and used as a fertiliser. 
                    When this is not practical, we can still dispose of it at any appropriate facility without worrying about chemical contamination.
                </p>
                <h3>Solids</h3>
                <p>
                    Solids are managed separately. Before each use, the toilet is lined with a compostable bag and filled with sawdust or hemp.
                    This keeps everything dry and odor-free during the initial composting stage.
                    After use, we tie the bag and store it until it can be transferred to a dedicated composting system.
                </p>

                <h2>Rubish</h2>
                <p>
                    From time to time, we have organic and dry materials to manage. Food scraps are layered with sawdust or hemp to prevent odours and pests until they can be added to a composting system. 
                    Dry materials that cannot be reused or repurposed are separated and stored until we find a suitable recycling centre to dispose of them.
